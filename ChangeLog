	* IMYplay version 0.4
	  Upgrade to newer autotools and gcc. Run flawfinder on the code and
	  changed some parts according to the result. Upgrade to gettext-0.17.
	  Corrected compiling for non-ANSI-C compilers.
	* imyplay.spi: fixed warnings displayed by rpmlint.
	* src/imyplay.h: renamed SAMPBUFSIZE, MIN, MAX, CURR_LIB, OCTAVES,
	  NOTES_PER_OCTAVE, error_type, show_error, sig_unk, err_msg_signal,
	  and notes to have the IMYP_/imyp_ prefix. Defined IMYP_ANSIC for
	  function prototypes.
	* configure.ac, configure: new command-line option --enable-MIDI to
	  enable/disable MIDI output (which is almost unaltered and thus
	  could cause problems with some compilers). New command-line option
	  --enable-EXEC to enable/disable the backend that executes the given
	  program instead of sound output.
	* src/Makefile.am, src/imypwrap.c: MIDI support now conditional.
	* src/imyp_jck.c: replaced free() with jack_free() and thus removed
	  including the stdlib and malloc header files. Verified compiling
	  against JACK2 header files. Verified working with JACK2 daemon.
	* src/imyp_jck.c, src/imyp_sdl.c, src/imyp_por.c: zero-out static
	  data structures on init. Decreasing the buffer index only when the
	  tone frequency was greater than zero, setting it to zero otherwise.
	  Synchronizing the callback functions to avoid zeroing the tone
	  frequency inside the loops.
	* src/imyp_mid.c: fixed the duration of notes and pauses.
	* src/imyp_exe.c: a new backend that executes a given program instead
	  of sound output.
	* src/imypwrap.c, src/imyplay.c, src/imyp_sig.c: EXEC backend support.
	* src/imyp_sdl.c: fixed signed/unsigned samples.
	* src/imyp_por.c (imyp_portaudio_play_tune): corrected closing the
	  audio stream.
	* src/imyp_all.c (imyp_all_pause): use select() if available.
	* src/imyp_als.c (imyp_alsa_play_tune): corrected filling the buffer.
	* src/imyp_ao.c (imyp_ao_play_tune): corrected filling the buffer.
	* src/imyp_oss.c (imyp_oss_play_tune): corrected filling the buffer.
	  Fixed signed/unsigned samples.
	* src/imyp_pul.c (imyp_pulse_play_tune): corrected filling the buffer.
	* src/imyp_sdl.c (imyp_sdl_play_tune): corrected initializing.
	* src/imyp_all.c (imyp_all_play_tune): corrected filling the buffer.
	* src/imyp_als.c (imyp_alsa_close): releasing the parameters' buffer.
	* src/imyp_mid.c (imyp_midi_init): making sure filename buffers are
	  zero-terminated.
	* src/imyp_als.c (imyp_alsa_init): fixed initializing the device.
	* src/imyplay.c: MIDI & EXEC backend command-line options now compiled
	  conditionally. Corrected parsing command-line options without getopt.

	* IMYplay version 0.3
	  SDL, ALSA, OSS, LIBAO, PortAudiov19, PulseAudio and JACK1 support.
	  Fixed endianess problem of 16-bit samples. Checking if the standard
	  output isn't NULL before printing text in the backends.
	* configure.ac: fixed: getopt.h no longer required, reacting on
	  parameters, check for off_t and size_t. Added "--enable-allegro",
	  "--enable-SDL", "--enable-ALSA", "--enable-LIBAO",
	  "--enable-PORTAUDIO", "--enable-PULSEAUDIO" and "--enable-JACK"
	  options.
	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: the program now really compiles
	  without the Allegro library.
	* imyplay.h: defining library constants, added IMYP_MAX_IMY_VOLUME,
	  added MIN() and MAX() macros.
	* imyp_sdl.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: SDL support.
	* imyplay.c, imyp_all.c, imyp_sdl.c: using IMYP_MAX_IMY_VOLUME.
	* imyp_als.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: ALSA support.
	* imyp_ao.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: LIBAO support.
	* imyp_por.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: PortAudiov19 support.
	* imyp_pul.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: PulseAudio support.
	* imyp_jck.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: JACK1 support.
	* imyplay.c (imyp_read_line): fixed getting the current file position.

2009-02-21	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* IMYplay version 0.2
	  Added converting IMY files to MIDI format 1, with the command-line
	  option '--to-midi' (affects all the files on the command line).
	  Added thanks. Moved text displaying to library-dependent code.
	* configure.ac: The Allegro library is required only for playing.
	  IMYplay will compile without it. Added a check for the 'volatile'
	  type. Removed some unused tests. The string.h header is required,
	  getopt.h is not.
	* src/imyp_cfg.hin: portability corrections.
	* src/imyp_sig.c: using only defined signals. Fixed displaying.

2009-01-20	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* IMYplay version 0.1
	  Complies to the iMelody specification (doc/imelody.txt), uses the
	  Allegro library, captures signals. Modular structure allows easy
	  adding new sound libraries in the future. Full documentation
	  included.

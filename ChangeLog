	* IMYplay version 0.2
	  Added converting IMY files to MIDI format 1, with the command-line
	  option '--to-midi' (affects all the files on the command line).
	  Added thanks. Moved text displaying to library-dependent code.
	* configure.ac: The Allegro library is required only for playing.
	  IMYplay will compile without it. Added a check for the 'volatile'
	  type. Removed some unused tests. The string.h header is required,
	  getopt.h is not.
	* src/imyp_cfg.hin: portability corrections.
	* src/imyp_sig.c: using only defined signals. Fixed displaying.

	* IMYplay version 0.1
	  Complies to the iMelody specification (doc/imelody.txt), uses the
	  Allegro library, captures signals. Modular structure allows easy
	  adding new sound libraries in the future. Full documentation
	  included.

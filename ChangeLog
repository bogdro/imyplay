	  Code cleanup, documentation updates. Corrected command-line parsing.
	  Corrected some backends' startup and shutdown. Corrected parsing
	  binary files. Fixed some memory leaks.
	* README, doc/imyplay.txc, INSTALL: added info that under DOS LFN
	  support can be enabled instead of renaming files required for

	  (imyp_sdl_play_tune), src/imyp_jck.c (imyp_jack_play_tune): removed
	  empty statements
	* src/imyparse.c (imyp_play_file): fixed variable casting, fixed
	  playing more than one file (resetting the parser state before each
	  file played)

	  math.h and unnecessary define of M_PI
	* src/imyp_exe.c: fixed #defines at the top
	* src/*.c: made the *_static structures really static (scope reduced)
	* src/imyplay.h: #undefining IMYP_ANSIC before redefinition, added

	  and IMYP_IS_DIGIT to imyplay.h.
	* src/imyp_por.c, src/imyp_sdl.c: prefer to use the library-specific
	  pause function instead of select().

	  (resetting the parser state before each file played)
	* src/imyparse.c (imyp_read_line, imyp_play_file): fixed variable

	  "--enable-SDL", "--enable-ALSA", "--enable-LIBAO",
	  "--enable-PORTAUDIO", "--enable-PULSEAUDIO" and "--enable-JACK"
	  options.
	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: the program now really compiles

	  option '--to-midi' (affects all the files on the command line).
	  Added thanks. Moved text displaying to library-dependent code.
	* configure.ac: The Allegro library is required only for playing.
	  IMYplay will compile without it. Added a check for the 'volatile'
	  type. Removed some unused tests. The string.h header is required,
	  getopt.h is not.
	* src/imyp_cfg.hin: portability corrections.
	* src/imyp_sig.c: using only defined signals. Fixed displaying.

2009-01-20	Bogdan Drozdowski <bogdandr@op.pl>

	* IMYplay version 0.1

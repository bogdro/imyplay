	* IMYplay version 0.3
	  SDL, ALSA, OSS, LIBAO, PortAudiov19, PulseAudio and JACK1 support.
	  Fixed endianess problem of 16-bit samples. Checking if the standard
	  output isn't NULL before printing text in the backends.
	* configure.ac: fixed: getopt.h no longer required, reacting on
	  parameters, check for off_t and size_t. Added "--enable-allegro",
	  "--enable-SDL", "--enable-ALSA", "--enable-LIBAO",
	  "--enable-PORTAUDIO", "--enable-PULSEAUDIO" and "--enable-JACK"
	  options.
	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: the program now really compiles
	  without the Allegro library.
	* imyplay.h: defining library constants, added IMYP_MAX_IMY_VOLUME,
	  added MIN() and MAX() macros.
	* imyp_sdl.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: SDL support.
	* imyplay.c, imyp_all.c, imyp_sdl.c: using IMYP_MAX_IMY_VOLUME.
	* imyp_als.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: ALSA support.
	* imyp_ao.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: LIBAO support.
	* imyp_por.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: PortAudiov19 support.
	* imyp_pul.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: PulseAudio support.
	* imyp_jck.{c,h}, imypwrap.c: JACK1 support.
	* imyplay.c (imyp_read_line): fixed getting the current file position.

	* IMYplay version 0.2
	  Added converting IMY files to MIDI format 1, with the command-line
	  option '--to-midi' (affects all the files on the command line).
	  Added thanks. Moved text displaying to library-dependent code.
	* configure.ac: The Allegro library is required only for playing.
	  IMYplay will compile without it. Added a check for the 'volatile'
	  type. Removed some unused tests. The string.h header is required,
	  getopt.h is not.
	* src/imyp_cfg.hin: portability corrections.
	* src/imyp_sig.c: using only defined signals. Fixed displaying.

	* IMYplay version 0.1
	  Complies to the iMelody specification (doc/imelody.txt), uses the
	  Allegro library, captures signals. Modular structure allows easy
	  adding new sound libraries in the future. Full documentation
	  included.
